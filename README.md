First project of data analysis using a single software MS Excel. I've used three steps to prepare this project.
Data Cleansing: Used features like filters to go through all the enormous data looking for a null or blank value. Initally found out a lot of blank value so replaced the blanks with 'Not Mentioned' words. Used find & replace option to commit all the changes.
Data Analysing: With the help of pivot tables, accurately arrannged the data based on the highest sales or demands and convert the data into percentages for easy understanding.
