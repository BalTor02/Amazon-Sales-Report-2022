First project of data analysis using a single software MS Excel. I've used three steps to prepare this project.

Data Cleansing: Used features like filters to go through all the enormous data looking for a null or blank value. Initally found out a lot of blank values so replaced the blanks with 'Not Mentioned' words. Used find & replace option to commit all the changes.

Data Analysing: With the help of pivot tables, accurately arrannged the data based on the highest sales or demands and convert the data into percentages for easy understanding.

Preparation of Report: The final report were prepared with the help of pivot charts linked to the tables and added some design factors for better visualization.

Observation: The highest demand is from the Maharashtra state which is almost 22% of the entire data followed by Karnataka & then Tamil nadu. The highest quantity from a city is from Bengaluru which is 18% and then Hyderabad and Mumbai. The most preferred size bought by the customers in terms of 100% is Medium which is about 17.61% then comes Large 17.16%, XL at 16.19% and so on.

Conclusion: For a proper sales, Amazon must supply it's products to highest demanding states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil nadu, etc whereas focusing on smooth supplying of huge quantities to other cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Mumbai while keeping a perfect stock of Medium sized apparels. Moreover, Amazon can also provide bonuses such as discount coupons, offers, ads to maintain and attract more customers, give cheap or free delivery for hugh quantities and can have an excess stock of certain sized clothings.
